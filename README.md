<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. 
Connect Four is a solved game ( a game whose outcome can be correctly predicted from any position). The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
